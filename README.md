# Image-Recognition-CNN-Handwritten-Digit-Classification
Handwritten digit classification using data augmentation 

 Overview
A Deep CNN implementation with Keras to recognize Handwritten Digits

# Libraries
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Skimage
Sklearn
Keras


# Parameters:
 ## Training “easy” blind test data set
  1. For “easy” blind test data set all the parameters(ex epoch, Optimizer, batch_size) are listed in the beggining of the /Handwritten-Character-Recognition/train.py file.

  2. Please specifing the paths for the dataset in test.py using the variables Xload and Yload.

  3. Please place the files of the dataset, label set and the trained_model. hdf5 in the Handwritten-Character-Recognition folder.

4. The best model will be saved in the ./Handwritten-Character-Recognition/trained_model.hdf5  .



## Testing “easy” blind test data set
  1. For “easy” blind test data set all the parameters are listed in the beggining of the Handwritten-Character-Recognition/test.py</b> file.

  2. For specifying the paths for the files of the dataset, please use the  test_data and test_labels variable.

3. Please place the files of the dataset, label set and the trained_model. hdf5 in the Handwritten-Character-Recognition folder.



# How to run test.py
